It helps users identify potential speculative plays on the differences in market prices, premiums, or discounts relative to the backing values of these tokens. By comparing the spread of these values, users can determine whether a token is overpriced or underpriced in relation to another, enabling strategic swaps to capitalize on these discrepancies.</p>
